# Villager Werewolf GT Problem.py

In the game theory problem this code attempts to answer, a werewolf enters a village with some number of villagers each night and eats one randomly chosen person. Each day before the werewolf arrives, any number of villagers may take a poison. At the end of each night, any villagers who took poison the previous day and any villagers who were eaten die. However, if the villager eaten by the werewolf ingested poison the previous day, the werewolf also dies, and the game stops. The problem is to find the optimal number of villagers who should ingest poison to maximize the expected number of survivors for each initial number of villagers up to 50.
