# Villager Werewolf GT Problem.py

In the game theory problem this code attempts to answer, a werewolf enters a village with some number of villagers each night and eats one randomly chosen person. Each day before the werewolf arrives, any number of villagers may take a poison. At the end of each night, any villagers who took poison the previous day and any villagers who were eaten die. However, if the villager eaten by the werewolf ingested poison the previous day, the werewolf also dies, and the game stops. The problem is to find the optimal number of villagers who should ingest poison to maximize the expected number of survivors for each initial number of villagers up to 50.

# baseball.py

My friend wanted me to create a Python program that he could use to easily simulate the expected number of points in an inning for different batting result rates. The possible results for a batter were walk, homerun, triple, double, single, and out, each with their baseball-specific interpretations. Additionally, when there is a lone baseman on first, they have a possibility of successfully stealing second, getting out trying to steal, or staying at first. The program allows the user to input the percentage likelihood of each of these discrete outcomes, as well as the desired number of trials, and outputs the simulated average number of points across that many trials.
